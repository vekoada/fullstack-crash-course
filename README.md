# Web Development Crash Course Progress Report

## Introduction

Hello there! This is my personal repo that I made while following along with the ["Web Development Crash Course" on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-crash-course/). 

## Why I Took This Course

I wanted to dip my toes in the water to see whether the topic was even interesting. There's something very appealing about being able to create something useful and not have it stay in the realm of imagination. 

## Next Steps

While I haven't completed the course (yet), I'm thinking that I'll continue with a more in-depth course. This was an interesting experience and I was able to get a foundational overview of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.
